# Downloading the Exercises

On your computer, create a directory where you want to store Programming 2 related material.
Open a terminal in this directory.
Enter the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/UCLL-PR2/exercises
```

All exercises have now been downloaded in a subdirectory named `exercises`.

> These instructions will get you going, but will be updated soon so as to make use of GitHub Classroom.
