# Assignment

Write a function `target_sum(ns, target)` that checks whether it is possible to take two values from `ns` whose sum equals `target`.
Each value in `ns` can only be used once.

For example, `target_sum([1, 2, 3], 5)` should return `True` because it is possible to make 5 using `2` and `3`.
Conversely, `target_sum([1, 2, 3], 7)` should return `False` because it is impossible to make 7.
